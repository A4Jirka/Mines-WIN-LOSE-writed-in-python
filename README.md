# Mines-WIN-LOSE-writed-in-python
This is minigame that is based on Minefield minigame (I gues its right)

Before you run this minigame you have to download python. You can find it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

How to run the minigame:
Press windows+R and type cmd. This should open your console.

(I recomend put the file in desktop) Type there this: cd %HOMEPATH%\Desktop\Mines\mines_game
Then type this: py main.py
If this doesnt work try this: python main.py
